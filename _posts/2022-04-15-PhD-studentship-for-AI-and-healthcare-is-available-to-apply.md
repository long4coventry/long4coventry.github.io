## PhD studentship for AI and healthcare research is available to apply.

Coventry University (CU) is inviting applications from suitably-qualified graduates for a fully-funded PhD studentship on ‘’AI and Data Science for population health’’, specifically focusing on the problem of predicting risk of diseases through developing machine learning models.

This PhD project aims to develop novel AI and machine learning models based on multi-source health data. The application of these new models will be used to understand and predict the evolution of multiple chronic diseases. The candidates are expected to have strong programming skills and previous experience on mainstream deep learning models.
